    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: January 26, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>FastCalo AI: Fasting & Calorie Tracker</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "Service").</p>

        <li><strong>Country:</strong> Used for localization (units of measurement) and compliance with local laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Used for account creation, password recovery, and support communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We collect data on how the Service is accessed and used, such as your fasting history, calorie logs, and feature usage. This helps us improve the app functionality.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data for various purposes:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Advertising (Free Users Only)</h2>

    <h2>6. Security of Data</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is important to us. We use industry-standard encryption to protect your personal information during transmission and storage. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>
